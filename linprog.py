lp_feasibility.py

Sets up and solves a simple linear program with variables x_i, y_i, t_i
for i=0..N, subject to constraints similar to the snippet provided:

  t_i - t_(i-1) = 1
  (x_i - x_(i-1)) Â± (y_i - y_(i-1)) <= 1
  0 <= x_i <= grid_n - 1
  0 <= y_i <= grid_m - 1

We create a minimal "dummy" objective (e.g., 0) to solve for feasibility.
